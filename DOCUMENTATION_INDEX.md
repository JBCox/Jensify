# Jensify Documentation Index

**Last Updated:** November 22, 2025
**Project Status:** Phase 0 Complete - All MVP Features Active

## 📖 Essential Documentation

**Core documentation files (kept minimal):**

| File | Purpose | Use When |
|------|---------|----------|
| **README.md** | Project setup, environment variables, getting started | Initial setup |
| **CLAUDE.md** | Coding standards, project structure, workflow | Every development session |
| **FEATURES.md** | Detailed docs for completed features (org, reports, PWA, GPS) | Understanding features |
| **HOW_JENSIFY_WORKS.md** | System architecture, features, how components work | Understanding the system |
| **FIX_AND_PREVENT_SYNC_ISSUES.md** | Database migration best practices | Making DB changes |
| **DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md** | This file - documentation navigation | Finding docs |

---

## 🎯 Documentation Philosophy

**Less is more.** We keep only essential documentation that is actively used:

- **CLAUDE.md** - Single source of truth for development standards
- **FEATURES.md** - Implementation details for completed features
- **HOW_JENSIFY_WORKS.md** - High-level system overview
- **FIX_AND_PREVENT_SYNC_ISSUES.md** - Critical database workflow
- **README.md** - Standard project introduction

**What we don't keep:**
- ❌ Task completion summaries (check git history instead)
- ❌ Migration troubleshooting docs (resolved issues)
- ❌ Temporary status updates (outdated quickly)
- ❌ Duplicate guides (consolidate into core docs)
